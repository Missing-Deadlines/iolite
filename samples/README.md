# Samples

The samples require the latest version of IOLITE `v0.1.8`.

Place the files in this directory in the root directory of IOLITE, load one of the worlds (most prefixed with `sample_`) in the editor, and switch to the game mode. That's it!

## Pathfinding (sample_pathfinding)

Sample showcases a simple procedurally generated maze and the pathfinding with multiple agents.

## Physics (sample_physics)

Example focusing on physics with FPS controls. Showcases the usage of joints to create more complex structures, ragdolls, support structures, etc.

### Controls

- Use `WASD` to move
- Use the mouse to rotate the camera
- Press `Space` to jump
- Press `Left Mouse Button` to throw a grenade
- Press `E` to spawn a ragdoll
- Press and hold `Right Mouse Button` to grab voxel shapes and move them around in the scene
