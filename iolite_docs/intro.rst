Feature Overview
----------------
   
* Highly specialized for dealing with large, highly detailed, and dynamic voxel worlds, made possible by modern desktop-level CPUs and GPUs
* Features fully dynamic real-time global illumination using a mixture of path tracing and screen space techniques; no ray tracing capable GPU required
* Implement your game using C/C++ or Lua; you can even create a custom scripting backend for the language of your choice
* Comes with a fully-featured editor for creating game worlds. Use our open-source plugins to extend the functionality, like, e.g., authoring voxel assets directly in the editor
* Extend the engine and editor functionality using the plugin system in conjunction with the native C/C++ API
* Highly flexible and thus not exclusively tied to creating games. Use IOLITE as a complete game creation package, solely as a renderer, for creating a procedural voxel editor, and more. The possibilities are endless
* Features subsystems for sound, particles, destruction, post-processing, and more right out of the box
