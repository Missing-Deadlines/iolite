What can I do with IOLITE? What is its license? Is it open-source software?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   
IOLITE is available as a free and paid (PRO) version. You're **free to create either commercial or non-commercial software with both versions**. While IOLITE's engine core is considered proprietary software, some of its functionality is provided as :ref:`open-source plugins <plugins>` licensed using the MIT license. The paid version finances the project's development and adds some additional features, as listed in :ref:`pro features`.

Both the PRO and the free versions are shipped without any form of DRM and share a straightforward license agreement:

Is IOLITE considered a finished product?
----------------------------------------
   
IOLITE is currently in its initial development phase and evolves constantly. The first *official release* will be marked by version 1.0.

.. note:: While creating amazing things with IOLITE is possible, we can not guarantee feature and API stability at this point. Please remember this when deciding to work on a project using IOLITE.

Help, IOLITE crashes during startup!
------------------------------------

Many checks are in place to ensure you end up with a meaningful error message in any possible failure case. If you encounter a startup crash, the chances are high that your GPU driver is outdated. Please use the most recent drivers from NVIDIA or AMD:

**Drivers for NVIDIA GPUs**
   https://www.nvidia.com/download/index.aspx
**Drivers for AMD GPUs**
   https://www.amd.com/en/support

Using the latest proprietary driver is your best bet when using Linux. Please ensure that your GPU driver is working correctly before trying to launch IOLITE.

If you're experiencing issues with the standalone Linux builds, it's potentially due to mismatches between the runtime libraries utilized by IOLITE and your Linux distribution.

How the hell do I exit the game mode again!?
----------------------------------------------

The default keybinding for opening the editor is ``[F3]``. You can adjust this in the ``keybindings_global.json`` file.

I only see a simple default scene; where are the samples?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Head over to our `GitHub repository <https://github.com/MissingDeadlines/iolite>`_ and place the contents of the ``iolite_samples`` directory right next to the IOLITE executable, overwriting any existing files.

.. Is it possible to use Lua auto-completion with IOLITE?
  --------------------------------------------------------

  You can find IOLITE's Lua scripting API as a LUA file in the Lua API documentation. Drop it close to your script, and your favorite IDE should pick it up automatically.

  If you use Visual Studio Code, install the `Lua extension <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sumneko.lua>`_ on the marketplace.

I would love to try writing a native plugin using the C/C++ API. Do I need IOLITE PRO?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The API header file is publicly available via our `public GitHub repository <https://github.com/MissingDeadlines/iolite>`_. In addition, the free version can also load native plugins, so it's possible to evaluate this feature before deciding to subscribe. Loading non-factory plugins in the free version will trigger a watermark.
